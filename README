Hello ,
Welcome to Sugiomoto Repo
to run this project you need to have node >v18 installed 
This project is running on Next14 and React 
Tailwind css is the main styling component in this project.

React Redux and Redux toolkit has been installed as the main state management dependencies and
we have two main slices called reviewSlice and cartSlice .
Redux Persist is also installed for offline rendering to reduce redundancies but inactive.

Based on the size and color you choose an object with a specific id will be stored on the centralized state and as 
for review state , you have the ability to delete and add reviews and their ratings as many as you’d like . 

Precision has been handled to a a high standard but not to perfection . 

TO RUN THE PROJECT YOU’D NEED TO RUN THESE COMMANDS IN ORDER AT THE ROOT DIRECTORY: (port 3000)
npm run install 
npm run dev
